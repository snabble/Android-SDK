## Feature Overview
### Scanning Products
The SDK comes with a standard scanner functionality and the ability to match the scanned data to products, coupons or even deposits. The product data is provided through the SDK with great performance and includes all necessary product details also covering special cases like age verification, multiple taxation options or product related discounts and promotions.
With this enriched product data and the provided SDK UI elements it is very simple to integrate a fully functional product scanner into your app.
### Offline Synchronisation
When entering a store with an app using the Snabble Mobile SDK, product data is downloaded into the app. This not only allows for a much faster scan result, but more importantly, it allows for scanning in areas of the store where no connection to the internet is available. After the purchase, product data is kept up-to-date via intelligent delta updates.
### Cart
The SDK comes with ready to use UI for the shopping cart that is already integrated into the scanner view. The cart handles not just adding and removing products but also synchronization with the Snabble Cloud-Platform. In this way the cart is automatically processed and updated by Snabble Cloud-Platform components like a promotion engine.
In this way the cart always shows correct pricing information considering applicable coupons, manual discounts, bundles or similar promotion logic.
The SDK UI elements for the cart already include visual representation of special cart items like 18+ products or applied promotions.
### Promotions
The Snabble Cloud-Platform already provides a powerful promotion engine to manage promotions. If you choose to use your own system to manage promotions this system will be integrated into the Snabble Cloud-Platform in advance. In all cases the SDK provides you with ready to use functionality for promotions.
There are two main promotion functions provided through the SDK:
manual discounts
manual discounts that can be selected by the customer during the scanning process. The SDK UI elements for the product scanner contain elements for the selection of manual discounts if these are configured in the promotion engine.
shopping cart calculation
automated calculation and updates of the shopping cart using the promotion logic attached to the Snabble Cloud-Platform. The visual representation of applied promotions is already included in the SDK UI elements for the shopping cart.
### Loyalty Cards
Loyalty Cards can be added to the app by scanning or entering the information using the keyboard. Added loyalty cards are then automatically applied to each checkout.

### Shop List And Details
A list of available shops is downloaded from the Snabble Cloud-Platform and shown in a table list inside the app. If the user has allowed to use geolocation, the shops are sorted by distance to the user. Also, a detail view of each shop is available, including a map view.
