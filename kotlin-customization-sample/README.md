# Fancy Sample App

This is a advanced sample App to show how to customize the SDK appearance to make the integration as
smooth as possible to your own design. It also shows how the app would look like with Material You
enabled. Please also check the other two sample apps in [kotlin-sample](../kotlin-sample) and
[java-sample](../java-sample) directory.

## Important notes

This is a tech demo what you can currently do with the Android SDK. That does not mean that the same
features are currently implemented in the iOS SDK too. The custom dialog confirmation dialog is a
technical preview and not yet supported on iOS.
