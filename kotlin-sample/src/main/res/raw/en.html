</p>
<p>In the following also referred to as &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;Snabble&rdquo;.</p>
<h2>Contract Conclusion</h2>
<p>The contract for the use of the app is concluded by your explicit agreement to these terms of use.</p>

<p>The Snabble app is configured to work only if you are in a store that allows shopping with the Snabble app (participating store). This is because Snabble only provides the technical infrastructure for mobile shopping (mobile self-checkout) at the store. A contract for goods or services is always only concluded between you and the merchant where you are located. An overview of the stores that support the Snabble app can be found in the app. There you will also find their contact details.</p>

<h2>Services Of The Snabble App</h2>
<p>The Snabble app allows you to scan your purchases at the stores listed in the app on your own. Afterwards you can pay for your purchase in different ways: At the cash desk, at a self-service checkout or directly online in the app. The options available to you depend on the store you are currently in.</p>

<p>In general, the Snabble app supports SEPA direct debit, credit card or payment at the cash register of the merchant. However, not all payment methods are available at every merchant. Snabble and the merchant explicitly reserve the right to exclude certain payment methods in individual cases or to make them dependent on further requirements.</p>

<p>A sales contract is only made between you as a customer and the respective merchant from whom you are shopping. Any claims in regard to the conclusion of the contract concerning the goods that have been scanned with the Snabble app can therefore only be asserted against the merchant whose contact data can be accessed via the app.</p>

<p>The payment processing takes place either at the merchant's checkout or, in case of online payment, via the merchant's payment provider that Snabble GmbH has connected in the app for this purpose. Snabble is not responsible for the processing of cashless payment by the respective payment provider. Snabble merely establishes a secure channel to the payment service provider according to the requirements of the Payment Services Directive. In case of wrong or incorrect bookings as well as disruptions in the payment process outside the Snabble app, you must contact the respective merchant or the payment service provider commissioned by the merchant yourself.</p>
<p>In case of online payment you will receive the receipt in the app. If you have chosen to pay online with the Snabble app, you also agree to waive a paper receipt.</p>
<p>The use of the Snabble app is free of charge for you. With this in mind, we cannot guarantee a minimum availability of the service. In particular, it is possible that the availability of the Snabble app may be temporarily unavailable partially or completely due to maintenance work or the elimination of technical malfunctions. By using the Snabble app, you cannot derive any claim to continuous use of the services. Snabble is entitled at any time and without prior notice, but taking into account your interests as a user, to change or temporarily or permanently suspend individual services. Furthermore, there is no entitlement to pay with the Snabble app in certain stores. Participating stores may vary in the future. In general, the merchant decides on the use of the Snabble app in his store.</p>

<h2>Requirements For Using The App</h2>
<p>In order to be able to pay with the Snabble app, you must be at least 14 years old and you must have entered your payment information for one of the offered payment methods and be authorized to access them. By using the payment function, you accept that the payment method or payment account selected by you will be debited with the amount of the payment for the goods in your shopping cart after the purchase is completed. Depending on the payment method, Snabble, the merchant or the payment service provider may require further authentication measures.</p>
<p>If you purchase via the app, you agree that store employees may carry out random checks in the checkout area or before leaving the checkout area and may require you to present the shopping cart, shopping bag or contents of the app.</p>
<p>Usage of the Snabble app requires an internet data connection and requires you to authorise access to the camera and location in your smartphone. Some local merchants also offer the possibility of using a Wi-Fi connection. The use of the Snabble app is only possible with a sufficient internet data connection. You will have to pay the connection costs for the data transfer yourself. The amount depends on the mobile phone contract between you and your telecommunications provider.</p>
<p>Some merchants allow you to store your store's customer card directly in the Snabble app so that you can use it automatically for future purchases. Please note that the conditions for shopping with the customer card are exclusively set by the respective merchants and Snabble has no influence on them.</p>
<p>Please note that you must install the updates we provide from time to time to use the Snabble app without errors.</p>
<p>As a user of the Snabble app you have to make sure that - if you have stored payment data in the app or have carried out an age verification with it - no other person than yourself has access to the app.</p>
<h2>Shopping With The App</h2>

<p>You agree to use the Snabble app to scan all the products of your purchase to the best of your knowledge and belief. You also ensure that if you remove products from the app's shopping cart, they will be returned to the shelf. Depending on the merchant, random samples can be performed. These random samples can cover individual items or the entire purchase. Please note any further requirements on site which are set and observed by the merchant (e.g. the obligation to use a trolley).</p>

<p>In the app you can always see your shopping cart, especially which products you have scanned and in what quantities. Before paying, you are obligated to check your shopping cart in the Snabble app. By starting the payment process ("Pay now"), you confirm that all products in your shopping cart or shopping basket have been completely and legitimately scanned.</p>

<p>A contract is only concluded when the goods have been paid for. Your contractual partner is the merchant who sells the goods and is listed as such on the store page in the Snabble app. In most cases you can make your payment directly with the app. However, for certain items such as alcohol - or in case of a random check - an employee may need to approve your purchase first. Once you have purchased the goods, we will show you how to behave on site, especially in order not to stand in a queue unnecessarily, in the app. In some stores, for example, we may ask you to scan a QR code from the app</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>
<p>The use of the Snabble app can be cancelled and terminated at any time and without notice. To do so, you must delete the app from your smartphone.</p>

<h2>Misuse</h2>
<p>Snabble has the right to prohibit you to use the Snabble app and to exclude you from using the Snabble app in case of reasonable suspicion of misuse of the Snabble app or repeated violation of these terms of use.</p>
<p>Any interference with the app or decompilation of the code is not permitted and will result in exclusion from use of the app. In particular, you are prohibited from copying, renting, editing or otherwise redesigning the Snabble app in whole or in part.</p>

<h2>Changes To The App</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to improve and change the app at any time.</p>

<h2>Changes Of The Terms Of Use</h2>
<p>You agree that we may change these terms of use. If these terms of use change, we will inform you about it when you start the app and ask you to agree again.</p>

<h2>Liability</h2>
<p>We are only responsible to you for the free provision of the services of the Snabble app in cases of intent and gross negligence. In case of violations of these terms of use as well as in case of legal infringements and corresponding claims of third parties, you expressly release Snabble GmbH from any liability and become fully liable for damages towards Snabble GmbH.</p>

<h2>Applicable Law</h2>
<p>The law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply.</p>
<p>Notice according to &sect; 36 VSBG: We are neither willing nor obliged to participate in a dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board.</p>

<h3>Storage Period Of Personal Data </h3>
<p>We store your personal data to enable you to use the Snabble app on an ongoing basis. We store this data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and in our Terms of Use or as required by law, e.g. to fulfill tax and commercial law retention obligations. For more information on the storage period, see the Data Collection section of the Snabble app. </p>
<h3>Encryption</h3>
<p>This app uses encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content that you send to us as the operator. This means that the data you send to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
<h3>Information, Restriction, Deletion And Correction</h3>
<p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to obtain information free of charge about your stored personal data, a right to correct, restrict processing and delete your data at any time. You can contact us at any time at the address given in the imprint for this purpose and for further questions about personal data.</p>

If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done as far as it is technically feasible.</p>

<p>You have the right to revoke at any time, for reasons arising from your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you that is carried out pursuant to article 6 section 1 letters e or f of the General Data Protection Regulation.

<h3>Revocation Of Consent</h3>
<p>If you have given us your consent for certain data processing, you have the right to revoke this consent at any time with effect for the future. However, this does not affect the legality of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation. </p>
<h3>Right Of Appeal To The Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation, Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27th, 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC), you have a right of appeal to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member State of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the suspected violation. This right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>
<h3>Need To Provide Personal Data </h3>
<p>In order to use the Snabble app, the processing of certain personal data is mandatory. This includes a randomly generated ID and your IP address. Without this data, the app cannot be used.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can provide us with additional personal data via the app (e.g. customer card numbers). As part of the payment function in the Snabble app, you have to provide us with certain personal data that is mandatory for the respective payment method. Otherwise, you cannot use this payment method. You can see which personal data is required when you add the payment methods in the app. Which data is required is determined by the payment service providers (more about this below in the explanations on data collection in the Snabble app).</p>
<h2>Data Processing Outside The EU/EEA</h2>
<h3>Server Location</h3>
<p>Our platform is stored on the servers of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. The data is stored exclusively on servers within the European Union and within the scope of application of the GDPR. </p>
<p>It may happen that in order to provide you with a certain service (e.g. map services), we also have to resort to service providers who process individual data outside the EU/European Economic Area (EEA) (e.g. in the USA). In these cases, we ensure by concluding so-called EU standard contract clauses that an adequate level of data protection is established at the recipient's premises before your personal data is transferred. Should this not be possible in exceptional cases, we will only process the data outside the EU if an exception in accordance with Art. 49 GDPR exists.</p>
<h2>Data Acquisition In The Snabble App</h2>
<h3>IP Address</h3>
<p>As the foundation of communication on the Internet, your IP address is transmitted to all systems with which the app communicates. For technical reasons it is absolutely necessary to record your IP address. In order to protect your privacy, however, the IP address is stored on our systems in an anonymous form and the original IP address is deleted within 48 hours, so that it is no longer possible to draw conclusions about your person.</p>
<h3>Client ID</h3>
<p>A Client ID is a random combination of digits and numbers that is generated when you install our app on your device and is used to clearly identify the device. </p>
<p>When you use the Snabble app, we store your client ID on our platform. The storage is based on art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. b &amp; lit. c. GDPR as part of the purchases made. We need this ID in order to be able to permanently assign your purchases and to display them in your shopping overview. The client ID will be deleted if you have not made any purchases with the app for more than three years.</p>
<h3>Age Characteristic</h3>
<p>When you buy age-restricted items via the app, your age is verified either by a merchant or store employee or by a payment method. This feature (over 16, over 18) is stored on the Snabble platform in conjunction with your Client ID so that you don't have to verify your age again for subsequent purchases. This data will be deleted if you have not made any purchases with the app for more than three years.</p>
<h3>Credit Card Data</h3>
<p>To use Snabble’s in-app payment feature, you must enter payment data into the app. This data is processed in accordance with the requirements of the applicable standards (e.g. PCI-DSS). At no point will Snabble temporarily store credit card data, instead it will forward this information directly to the payment provider. During this process, Snabble receives a so-called token to identify the payment data for a follow-up transaction.</p>
<p>When initially registering a credit card in the Snabble app, a card verification process must be carried out. In order to verify your credit card, you will be redirected to your bank after entering the data. There, you will be asked to agree to a small payment. This amount will be immediately credited back to you after you give your consent.</p>
<p>For the purpose of payment (Art. 6 para. 1 letter b GDPR), the payment data is forwarded to the payment provider commissioned by the retailer. Depending on the payment type, this data includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your first and last name</li>
  <li>Your IBAN or credit card number or credit card token</li>
  <li>The amount to be paid</li>
  <li>The payment recipient</li>
</ul>
<p>The relevant payment providers are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Data GmbH, Marienbader Platz 1, 61348 Bad Homburg vor der Höhe, Germany</li>
  <li>PAYONE GmbH, Lyoner Straße 9, 60528 Frankfurt am Main, Germany</li>
  <li>Datatrans AG, Kreuzbühlstrasse 26, CH-8008 Zürich, Switzerland</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of a purchase, a tax and commercial law retention obligation of 10 years applies to the storage, beginning at the end of the calendar year.</p>
<h3>Shopping Cart And Receipt Data</h3>
<p>Products scanned with the Snabble app are stored locally in the app so that they can be displayed in your shopping cart. At the same time, we transfer the scan events and the current shopping cart to the Snabble platform for storage (art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR). The merchant from whom you are currently shopping can also view your shopping cart (Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR) and retrieve it via a technical interface for integration into their POS systems (Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR).</p>
<p>When paying with the Snabble app, receipt data is generated. This data contains both the shopping cart and the method of payment. We also store this data in the Snabble platform (art. 6 paragraph 1 lit. b GDPR). The receipt data is transferred to the merchant from whom the purchase was made in order to fulfil the contract (art. 6 paragraph 1 b GDPR).</p>
<h3>Location Data</h3>
<p>The Snabble app uses your current location. However, this location is only used locally on your device to automatically select the store where you shop. This is only done if you have agreed to access the location on your device.</p>
